    "Critical in the evaluation of the NHM simulated flows is the comparison to observed flows. This notebook retrieves available streamflow observations from NWIS and two state agencies, the Oregon Water Resources Department (OWRD) and the Washington Department of Ecology (ECY), combines these data sets into one daily streamflow observations file with streamflow gage information and metadata, and writes the database out as a netCDF file (`sf_efc.nc`) to be used in Notebook \"6_streamflow_output_visualization\" and other notebooks in NHM-Assist. Included in the `sf_efc.nc` are Environmental Flow Components (EFC) for daily flows using a python workflow (also in this notebook) as described by [Risley and others, 2010](https://pubs.usgs.gov/sir/2010/5016/pdf/sir20105016.pdf). \n",
