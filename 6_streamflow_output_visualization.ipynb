    "## Introduction\n",
    "The purpose of this notebook is to assist in the evaluation of NHM subdomain model simulated streamflow. First, the notebook creates a map of gage locations color coded by Kling-Gupta efficiency (KGE; [2009](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S0022169409004843)) value. Gage locations are overlays in a map of NHM headwater basins (HWs) that are color coded to calibration type: yellow indicates HWs calibrated with statistical streamflow targets at the HW outlet; green indicates HWs that were further calibrated with streamflow observations at selected gage locations.\n",
    "Next, a gage may be selected and a plot created that shows a time-series of simulated and observed streamflow at daily, monthly, and annual time steps. A flow exceedance curve and table of summary statistics is also provided in the plot for streamflow evaluation purposes. Additionally, maps and plots produced are saved for use outside of notebooks as HTML files in the `html_maps` and `html_plots` folders in the `notebook_output` folder.\n",
    "\n",
    "The cell below reads the NHM subdomain model hydrofabric elements for mapping purposes using `make_hf_map_elements()`, retrieves `pywatershed` output file information for mapping and plotting using `retrieve_hru_output_info()`, and writes general NHM subdomain model run and hydrofabric information."

    "The following cell creates a map of the NHM subdomain model hydrofabric elements and displays monthly Kling-Gupta efficiency (KGE) values for parameter file gages as red (KGE<0.5), yellow (0.5<=KGE<0.7), and green (KGE>=0.7). The map is interactive, made with [folium](https://python-visualization.github.io/folium/v0.18.0/index.html) (see [README](./README.md) for basic map interactive functionality). Use the mouse to left-click on gage icons and display the gage id and gage name. Use the mouse to left-click on HRUs to display the headwater basin (HW) id. HW groupings of HRUs are important when interpreting parameter values and output variables. HRU parameters were grouped by HW and adjusted using a scaling factor during the byHW and byHWobs parts of NHM calibration ([Hay and others, 2023](https://pubs.usgs.gov/tm/06/b10/tm6b10.pdf)). During the byHW calibration part, statistical flow targets at HW outlets were used, and during the subsequent byHWobs part, streamflow obervations were used for selected HWs."
